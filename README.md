# Web_Design_Challenge
## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
-- All files can be found in Start Files folder --

For this challenge, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I've created in a past challenge. Specifically, I plotted weather data.

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which I can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where I can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where I can view the data used to build them.

### Website Requirements
The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

1. A landing page containing:
a. An explanation of the project.
b. Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

2. Four visualization pages, each with:
a. A descriptive title and heading tag.
b. The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
c. A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

3. A "Comparisons" page that:
a. Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
b. Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
c. The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

4. A "Data" page that:
a. Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
b. The table must be a bootstrap table component.
c. The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. 

5. The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
a. Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
b. Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
c. Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
d. Is responsive (using media queries).
